# mtmo-cli

I'm lazy and I like to minimize how many keystrokes I need to do.
So I wrote this bash wrapper for common Matomo commands I use daily.

Inspired by [bagcli](https://github.com/brotandgames/bagcli).

## Example usage

Build vue files:
```
mtmo vue build MyPlugin
```

Watch em':
```
mtmo vue watch MyPlugin
```

## For the future

Just for fun and practice I'm thinking about rebuilding this in Go.
